# OpenGL 3D Model Viewer

This project focuses on using OpenGL to load and display 3D models, showcasing many values such as Blinn-Phong lighting etc in a 3D environment.

## Project Overview:

The OpenGL 3D Model Viewer is designed to provide a visual representation of 3D models in a 3D Enviroment. 

- **Model Loading:** Utilize OpenGL to load 3D models into the application.
- **Blinn-Phong Lighting:** Display models with the Blinn-Phong shading model.
- **UI:** Using the UI it displays the values of each model and the FPS.

## Features:
- **Model Display:** Showcasing and loading 3D Models.
- **Blinn-Phong Lighting:** Implement advanced lighting techniques for realistic shading.
- **User Interface:** Using the UI it displays the values of each model and the FPS so it can be seen when we run the application.

What has been done and how does it work:In the project i have added the ability to show FPS And the Rough/Matte/Glossy in both console and in the UI of the application. The fps are also shown in the application window name. The user/teacher doesn't have to press any button for them to show them,they are automatically being shown when the application starts.
